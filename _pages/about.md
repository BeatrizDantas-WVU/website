Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Ph.D. Candidate (Graduate Research Assistant) at [West Virginia University](https://www.wvu.edu/) in Chemical Engineering, in the [CODES Research Group](https://fernandolima.faculty.wvu.edu/) and also hold a Masterâ€™s degree also in Chemical Engineering. 

I have experience in :
- Process modeling
- Advanced process control
- Plantwide control
- Nonlinear constrained optimization
- Machine learning

Applied to process systems engineering.

My current ambition is to conduct further research on the design, modeling, control and assessment of chemical processes. I have experience working with the oil and gas industry, as well as the petrochemical.
